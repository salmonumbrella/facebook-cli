# Facebook MCP Server & CLI Tools

> **Inspired by [HagaiHen/facebook-mcp-server](https://github.com/HagaiHen/facebook-mcp-server)** — rewritten in TypeScript with **multi-page management** via a `FACEBOOK_ASSETS` JSON configuration. Source: [2b3pro/facebook-mcp-cli](https://github.com/2b3pro/facebook-mcp-cli)

A **TypeScript MCP server** for automating and managing interactions on Facebook Pages using the Facebook Graph API. Exposes 53 tools for posting, comment moderation, analytics, engagement tracking, video/reels/stories publishing, slideshows, crossposting, and A/B testing — ready to plug into Claude Desktop or other LLM-based agents. Includes a standalone CLI for direct shell access.

---

## What Is This?

This MCP provides a suite of AI-callable tools that connect directly to Facebook Pages, abstracting common API operations as LLM-friendly functions.

### Benefits

- Empowers **social media managers** to automate moderation and analytics.
- Seamlessly integrates with **Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible agent**.
- Enables fine-grained control over Facebook content from natural language.
- **Standalone CLI** (`cli/fbcli.ts`) for direct shell scripting and automation.

## Features

All tools (except `list_pages`) take `page_name` as the first parameter — a slug-style identifier for the target page (e.g. `"mybusiness"`).

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2b3pro/facebook-mcp-cli.git
cd facebook-mcp-cli
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime:

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root with a `FACEBOOK_ASSETS` JSON array:

```
FACEBOOK_ASSETS='[{"fb_page_id":"123456","page_name":"mybusiness","display_name":"My Business Page","page_access_token":"EAA..."},{"fb_page_id":"789012","page_name":"sideproject","display_name":"Side Project","page_access_token":"EAA..."}]'
```

Each entry requires:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `fb_page_id` | Facebook Page ID |
| `page_name` | Slug identifier (lowercase, no spaces) — used as first param in all tools |
| `display_name` | Human-readable label |
| `page_access_token` | Page access token from [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) |

### 4. Run the MCP Server

```bash
bun run src/server.ts
```

---

## Using with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.claude.json` under `mcpServers`):

```json
"facebook-mcp": {
  "command": "bun",
  "args": ["run", "/path/to/facebook-mcp-cli/src/server.ts"],
  "env": {
    "FACEBOOK_ASSETS": "[{\"fb_page_id\":\"123\",\"page_name\":\"mypage\",\"display_name\":\"My Page\",\"page_access_token\":\"EAA...\"}]"
  }
}
```

---

## CLI

A standalone CLI is available at `cli/fbcli.ts` for direct shell access to all the same operations. See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for full documentation.

```bash
bun run cli/fbcli.ts --help
bun run cli/fbcli.ts pages
bun run cli/fbcli.ts posts mybusiness
```

Commands that accept text content or ID lists support **stdin piping** — omit the argument and pipe input instead:

```bash
cat draft.txt | fbcli post mybusiness
echo "Thanks!" | fbcli reply mybusiness 123_456
fbcli comments mybusiness 123_456 | jq -r '.data[].id' | fbcli bulk-hide mybusiness
```

---

## Architecture

### MCP Server (`src/`)

```
src/server.ts  →  src/api.ts  →  Facebook Graph API
(MCP tools)       (HTTP wrapper)
     ↑
src/config.ts
(env + types)
```

- **src/config.ts** — `PageAsset` interface, env loading, API base URL
- **src/api.ts** — `graphApi()`, `ruploadApi()`, `resumableUpload()`, `graphApiBatch()` HTTP wrappers
- **src/server.ts** — All 53 MCP tools via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`

### CLI (`cli/`)

Self-contained single-file CLI at `cli/fbcli.ts`. Independent of the MCP server — reads its own `.env`.
